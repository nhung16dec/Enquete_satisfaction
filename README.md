Following an SAE (Situation d’Apprentissage et d’Évaluation), we were asked to conduct a survey proposed in class. We decided to carry out an investigation on a carefully chosen topic: the satisfaction of students at the IUT concerning the Inter-administrative Restaurant of Carcassonne, also known as RIAC.
<ul>
  <li>Population: The students of IUT Carcassonne</li>
  <li>Sample size: 202 respondents</li>

    
  
</ul>
The student satisfaction questionnaire regarding the RIAC consists of 31 questions distributed across 6 themes:

    Getting to know you better – p.1 of the questionnaire
    Within the RIAC – p.1 of the questionnaire
    Services and cost – p.2 of the questionnaire
    The environment – p.3 of the questionnaire
    Meal quality – p.3 of the questionnaire
    Conclusion – p.3 of the questionnaire

There are 6 types of questions:

    1 Open-ended question
    1 Closed-ended multiple-choice question
    3 Closed-ended multiple-choice questions combined with open-ended questions
    4 Closed-ended binary choice questions
    4 Closed-ended binary choice questions combined with open-ended questions
    18 Closed-ended scale questions (ranging from Very satisfactory to Unsatisfactory) combined with open-ended questions (If little or unsatisfactory, why?)
